// build 520: remote players'/bots' attached gun rendered arena-sized. Two causes:
//  (1) the weapon was sent as a numeric index, so WEAPONS[n] was undefined (stray model) and tpGunGrip(n)
//      returned a fresh scale:1 default instead of the tuned grip — fixed by sending the weapon key string;
//  (2) the default grip scale was tied to the GLB's authored size — fixed by normalizing the gun model to a
//      real-world size on load, so the grip scale is authoring-independent.

// (1) weapon key is a string over the wire
