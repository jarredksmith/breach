// (build 799) The on-foot third-person camera clipped through walls and props. Its old collision was a NON-recursive ray
// straight back from the pivot — it missed props whose geometry sits in child meshes, and it ignored the over-the-shoulder
// side/height offset (the camera actually sits beside that ray). It now reuses _cameraCollide, which casts recursively to
// the REAL offset camera position, so nested prop/model meshes count and an OTS camera can't punch through geometry.
